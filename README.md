# Menus for wp-json API V2

This is a WordPress plugin to add menus to V2 of the [WP-API](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API).

## Usage

Usage is pretty simple. Upload the plugin to your plugins directory and activate it in the WP Admin.

You'll then see a new namspace registered in the API `menus/v1`. Using this namsepace, you can access your menus.
